Gradle with xjb and xjc examples

I just followed the examples from https://github.com/jacobono/gradle-jaxb-plugin , looks like this plugin is official added to gradle.
all you have to do is just added the plugin and declare the xjb and use the xjc to compile and convert the xsd to java files. its pretty simple.


To run the script.
gradle xjc
