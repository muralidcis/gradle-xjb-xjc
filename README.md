:exclamation:IMPORTANT PLUGIN ID CHANGES:exclamation:

In compliance with the gradle plugin submission guidelines, this
plugin's id is now *fully* qualified.

It changed from `jaxb` to `com.github.jacobono.jaxb`.  This affects
how you apply the plugin (`apply plugin: 'com.github.jacobono.jaxb'`)

:boom: :collision:

Gradle plugin that defines some conventions for xsd projects and
provides some processing to ease some of the maintenance of these
projects by:

* Hooking in ant tasks to parse the xsd with the `xjc` task.
* Generates code from xsds per unique namespace.
* Generates an xsd dependency tree, to parse namespaces in their
  order of dependencies, from the base namespaces up.
* Generating an episode file for every unique namespace in a set
  of xsd files
* Defining a convention to place generated episode files
* Ability to define xsd projects to depend on one another, so
  that when parsing, what a project depends on is also parsed

Using The Plugin
================

:boom: :collision:

Now in the [gradle plugins repo](http://plugins.gradle.org/) :exclamation:

:boom: :collision:

new group id `com.github.jacobono` matches gradle plugin id.

:boom: :collision:

## Using Gradle 2.1 plugins script block
```groovy
plugins {
    id 'com.github.jacobono.jaxb' version '1.3.6'
}
```

## Using Straight-Up JCenter
```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    jcenter()
    mavenCentral()
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.github.jacobono:gradle-jaxb-plugin:1.3.6'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'com.github.jacobono.jaxb'
```

Setting Up The JAXB Configurations
==================================

You *need* the jaxb configuration to run the `xjc` task, but that is the
only task that has an external dependency.

Any version of jaxb that you care to use will work.  I try to stay with the latest releases.

```groovy
    dependencies { 
      jaxb 'com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-xjc:2.2.7-b41'
      jaxb 'com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl:2.2.7-b41'
      jaxb 'javax.xml.bind:jaxb-api:2.2.7'
    }
```

Plugin Tasks
============

There are only two tasks.

* `xjc`
	- runs `xjc` ant task on each `.xsd` in the dependency tree.
	- needs to be run **manually**.
* `xsd-dependency-tree`
	- Builds a dependency tree from all `.xsd` files configured to be
      parsed.
	- Finds each unique namespace and groups files containing that
      namespace
	- Analyzes xsd dependencies and places them in the correct place
      in the dependency tree so that the namespaces can be parsed in
      order using their generated episode files to bind, allowing
      other projects to use the episode files generated from the
      namespace in the tree.
	  - This keeps all namespaces decoupled and prevents a big
        episode blob containing everything that was parsed.

`xjc` depends on `xsd-dependency-tree` so you don't need to run the
tree task at all.

Plugin Conventions
==================

There are two conventions that can be overridden and one is nested in
the other.

The `jaxb` convention defines the conventions for the whole plugin,
and the `xjc` convention defines the conventions for the `xjc` ant
task.

You can change these defaults with a closure in your build
script.

```groovy
    jaxb {
	  ...
      xjc {
	    ...
	  }
    }
```

## JAXB Plugin Convention ##

There are 4 overrideable defaults for this JAXB Plugin.
These defaults are changed via the `jaxb` closure.

* `xsdDir`
  * **ALWAYS** relative to `project.rootDir`
	* Defined **by each** project to tell the plugin where to find the
      `.xsd` files to parse
* `episodesDir`
  * **ALWAYS** relative to `project.rootDir`
	* i.e. _"episodes"_, _"schema/episodes"_, _"xsd/episodes"_,
      _"XMLSchema/episodes"_
	* **All** generated episode files go directly under here, no subfolders.
* `bindingsDir`
  * **ALWAYS** relative to `project.rootDir`
	* i.e. "bindings", "schema/bindings", "xsd/bindings",
      "XMLSchema/bindings"
    * User defined binding files to pass in to the `xjc` task
	* **All** files are directly under this folder, _no subfolders_.
* `bindings`
  * customization files to bind with
  * file name List of strings found in `bindingsDir`
  * if there are bindings present, xjc will be called once with the
    glob pattern `**/*.xsd` to snag everything under `xsdDir`.  Fixes
    #27.

## XJC Convention ##

These defaults are changed via the nested `xjc` closure.
Several sensible defaults are defined to be passed into the
`wsimport` task:

| parameter				 | Description									    | default		  | type	  |
| :---					 | :---:										    | :---:			  | ---:	  |
|`destinationDir` _(R)_	 | generated code will be written to this directory | `src/main/java` | `String`  |
|`extension` _(O)_		 | Run XJC compiler in extension mode			    | `true`		  | `boolean` |
|`header` _(O)_			 | generates a header in each generated file	    | `true`		  | `boolean` |
|`producesDir` _(O)(NI)_ | aids with XJC up-to-date check				    | `src/main/java` | `String`  |
|`generatePackage` _(O)_ | specify a package to generate to				    | **none**		  | `String`  |
|`args` _(O)_ | List of strings for extra arguments to pass that aren't listed | **none** | `List<String>` |
|`removeOldOutput` _(O)_ | Only used with nested `<produces>` elements, when _'yes'_ all files are deleted before XJC is run | _'yes'_ | `String` |
|`taskClassname` _(O)_ | Enables a custom task classname if using something other than jaxb | `com.sun.tools.xjc.XJCTask` | `String` |

* (O) - optional argument
* (R) - required argument
* (NI) - not implemented / not working

For more in depth description please see
https://jaxb.java.net/2.2.7/docs/ch04.html#tools-xjc-ant-task -- or
substitute the version you are using.

### destinationDir ###

`destinationDir` is relative to `project.projectDir`.  It is
defaulted to `src/main/java`, but can be set to anywhere in
`project.projectDir`.

### producesDir ###

`producesDir` is not currently used in the plugin.  But it was meant
to be in there so that if no xsd changes have happened, then no
code generation would take place.  *Hasn't worked yet.*

### taskClassname ###

`taskClassname` is the class to be used to run the xjc task.  Useful if
JAXB2 is desired to be used.

### Extra Arguments ###
`args` passes arbitrary arguments to the `xjc` ant task. This is useful
when activating JAXB2 plugins.

# Examples #

## Default Example using JAXB ##

If the default conventions aren't changed, the only thing to configure
_(per project)_ is the `xsdDir`, and jaxb dependencies as described above.

```groovy
jaxb {
  xsdDir = "schema/folder1"
}
```

## Default Example using JAXB2 ##

Customized to use the same `xjc` task that
[xjc-mojo](http://mojo.codehaus.org/jaxb2-maven-plugin/xjc-mojo.html)
uses.

```groovy
dependencies {
  jaxb "org.jvnet.jaxb2_commons:jaxb2-basics-ant:0.6.5"
  jaxb "org.jvnet.jaxb2_commons:jaxb2-basics:0.6.4"
  jaxb "org.jvnet.jaxb2_commons:jaxb2-basics-annotate:0.6.4"
}

jaxb {
  xsdDir = "some/folder"
  xjc {
     taskClassname      = "org.jvnet.jaxb2_commons.xjc.XJC2Task"
	 generatePackage    = "com.company.example"
     args               = ["-Xinheritance", "-Xannotate"]
  }
}
```

Defining The Plugin For All Projects
====================================

I like to create a convention for xsd projects to have a suffix of
`-schema`.  I find it easy to then write:

```groovy
subproject { project ->
  if(project.name.endsWith("-schema")) { 
    apply plugin: 'com.github.jacobono.jaxb'

    dependencies { 
      jaxb 'com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-xjc:2.2.7-b41'
      jaxb 'com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl:2.2.7-b41'
      jaxb 'javax.xml.bind:jaxb-api:2.2.7'
    }
  }
}
```

applying the plugin to all schema projects.

Other Features
==============

## Depend On Another Project

This lets gradle know that the xjc task of a project is dependent on
the xjc task of another project.  This can be achieved with:

```groovy
dependencies {
  jaxb project(path: ':common', configuration: 'jaxb')
}
```

I like how this expresses that xsd's definitely depend on other xsd's
outside of their parent folder `xsdDir`.

This will run the xjc task on `common` before running the xjc task of
of the project this is defined in.

Examples
========

You can find some examples in the [examples folder](examples)

Improvements
============

If you think this plugin could be better, please fork it! If you have an idea
that would make something a little easier, I'd love to hear about it.
